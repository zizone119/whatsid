        <property name='df_LT.license' value='Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC&#xA;LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation&#xA;distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are&#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos;&#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor&#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not&#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of&#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own&#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are&#xA;necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this&#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,&#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to&#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly&#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,&#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under&#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise&#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and&#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is&#xA;added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such&#xA;combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license&#xA;shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses&#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any&#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other&#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor&#xA;disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other&#xA;entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted&#xA;hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure&#xA;any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a&#xA;third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute&#xA;the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license&#xA;before distributing the Program.&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient&#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright&#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under&#xA;its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties&#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or&#xA;conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or&#xA;conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for&#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and&#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are&#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such&#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable&#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained&#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,&#xA;if&#xA;any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the&#xA;originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with&#xA;respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is&#xA;intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who&#xA;includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,&#xA;if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such&#xA;Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify&#xA;every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses,&#xA;damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and&#xA;other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial&#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims&#xA;or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property&#xA;infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:&#xA;a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and&#xA;b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the&#xA;Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement&#xA;negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at&#xA;its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If&#xA;that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are&#xA;such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the&#xA;Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other&#xA;Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a&#xA;court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the&#xA;Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN&#xA;&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR&#xA;IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each&#xA;Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using&#xA;and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its&#xA;exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the&#xA;risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to&#xA;or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of&#xA;operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY&#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,&#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION&#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN&#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)&#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE&#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under&#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the&#xA;remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the&#xA;parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent&#xA;necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself&#xA;(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)&#xA;infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted&#xA;under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to&#xA;comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does&#xA;not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of&#xA;such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate,&#xA;Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement&#xA;and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue&#xA;and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in&#xA;order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be&#xA;modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to&#xA;publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to&#xA;time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The&#xA;Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement&#xA;Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will&#xA;be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including&#xA;Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the&#xA;Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program&#xA;(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly&#xA;stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or&#xA;licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,&#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the&#xA;Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the&#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this&#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year&#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in&#xA;any resulting litigation.&#xA;'/>

        <property name='df_LT.license' value='Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC&#xA;LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation&#xA;distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are&#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos;&#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor&#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not&#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of&#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own&#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are&#xA;necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this&#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,&#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to&#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly&#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,&#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under&#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise&#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and&#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is&#xA;added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such&#xA;combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license&#xA;shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses&#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any&#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other&#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor&#xA;disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other&#xA;entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted&#xA;hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure&#xA;any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a&#xA;third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute&#xA;the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license&#xA;before distributing the Program.&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient&#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright&#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under&#xA;its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties&#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or&#xA;conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or&#xA;conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for&#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and&#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are&#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such&#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable&#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained&#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,&#xA;if&#xA;any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the&#xA;originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with&#xA;respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is&#xA;intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who&#xA;includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,&#xA;if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such&#xA;Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify&#xA;every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses,&#xA;damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and&#xA;other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial&#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims&#xA;or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property&#xA;infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:&#xA;a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and&#xA;b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the&#xA;Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement&#xA;negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at&#xA;its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If&#xA;that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are&#xA;such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the&#xA;Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other&#xA;Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a&#xA;court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the&#xA;Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN&#xA;&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR&#xA;IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each&#xA;Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using&#xA;and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its&#xA;exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the&#xA;risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to&#xA;or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of&#xA;operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY&#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,&#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION&#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN&#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)&#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE&#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under&#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the&#xA;remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the&#xA;parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent&#xA;necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself&#xA;(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)&#xA;infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted&#xA;under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to&#xA;comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does&#xA;not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of&#xA;such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate,&#xA;Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement&#xA;and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue&#xA;and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in&#xA;order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be&#xA;modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to&#xA;publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to&#xA;time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The&#xA;Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement&#xA;Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will&#xA;be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including&#xA;Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the&#xA;Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program&#xA;(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly&#xA;stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or&#xA;licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,&#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the&#xA;Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the&#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this&#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year&#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in&#xA;any resulting litigation.&#xA;'/>

        <property name='df_LT.license' value='LICENSE INFORMATION&#xA;&#xA;The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International Program License Agreement (i125-3301-15) applies.&#xA;&#xA;Program Name (Program Number):&#xA;IBM WebSphere Application Server Developer Tools for Eclipse 24.1 (Tool)&#xA;&#xA;The following standard terms apply to Licensee&apos;s use of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Modifiable Third Party Code&#xA;&#xA;To the extent, if any, in the NOTICES file IBM identifies third party code as &quot;Modifiable Third Party Code,&quot; IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee&apos;s modifications to such third party code. IBM&apos;s service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.&#xA;&#xA;The following units of measure may apply to Licensee&apos;s use of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Authorized User&#xA;&#xA;Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;L/N: L-LAAY-6AA88B&#xA;D/N: L-LAAY-6AA88B&#xA;P/N: L-LAAY-6AA88B&#xA;&#xA;International Program License Agreement&#xA;&#xA;Part 1 - General Terms&#xA;&#xA;BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY: i) DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND ii) PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA, DOCUMENTATION, AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.&#xA;&#xA;This International Program License Agreement (IPLA) and applicable Transaction Documents (together the &quot;Agreement&quot;) are the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of a Program. The country required terms included in Part 2 of this IPLA replace or modify the terms of Part 1.&#xA;&#xA;Transaction Documents (TDs) provide a description, information, and terms regarding the Program and its authorized use. Examples of TDs for Programs include license information (LI), licensed program specifications (LPS), quote, proof of entitlement (PoE), or invoice. To the extent of any conflict a TD will prevail over the IPLA.&#xA;&#xA;1. Program License&#xA;&#xA;a. A Program is an executable IBM-branded computer program and its related material and includes whole and partial copies. Program details are described in a TD available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla (for Passport Advantage Programs) or http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter (for other IBM Programs), in the Program&apos;s system command directory, or as otherwise specified by IBM. IBM software policies (such as backup, temporary use and IBM approved cloud environment) available at http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies apply to Licensee&apos;s use of Programs.&#xA;&#xA;b. Copies of Programs are copyrighted and licensed.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee is granted a nonexclusive license to:&#xA;&#xA;(1) use each copy of a Program, subject to the terms of the Agreement and up to the number of license entitlements Licensee acquires (&quot;Authorized Use&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;(2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use; and&#xA;&#xA;(3) make a backup copy.&#xA;&#xA;d. Programs may be used by Licensee, its employees and contractors. Licensee may not rent or lease a Program or provide commercial IT, hosting or timesharing services to any third party. Additional rights may be available for additional fees or under different terms.&#xA;&#xA;e. The license granted for a Program is subject to Licensee:&#xA;&#xA;(1) reproducing copyright notices and other markings on any copy;&#xA;&#xA;(2) ensuring anyone who uses the Program: i) does so only on Licensee&apos;s behalf within Licensee&apos;s Authorized Use; and ii) complies with this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;(3) not reverse assembling, reverse compiling, translating, or reverse engineering the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; and&#xA;&#xA;(4) not using any of the elements of the Program or related licensed materials separately from the Program.&#xA;&#xA;f. If the TD for a Program (&quot;Principal Program&quot;) states that a &quot;Supporting Program&quot; is included with the Principal Program, Licensee may use the Supporting Program subject to any license limitations of the Principal Program and only to support the Principal Program.&#xA;&#xA;g. This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.&#xA;&#xA;h. An update, fix, or patch to a Program is subject to the terms governing the Program unless new terms are provided in an updated TD. Licensee accepts such new terms upon installation of the update, fix, or patch. If a Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.&#xA;&#xA;i. If Licensee is dissatisfied with a Program for any reason, Licensee may terminate the license by returning the Program and proof of entitlement to IBM or the authorized IBM Business Partner within 30 days of the original acquisition date of such Program for a refund of the amount paid. For a downloaded Program, contact the party Licensee acquired the Program from for refund instructions.&#xA;&#xA;2. Warranties&#xA;&#xA;a. IBM warrants that a Program, when used in its specified operating environment conforms to its specifications. The warranty period for a Program is 12 months from acquisition, or the initial license term if less than 12 months, unless another warranty period is specified in the TD.&#xA;&#xA;b. During the warranty period Licensee will have access to IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses as described in the IBM Support Guide at http://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/733923.&#xA;&#xA;c. If the Program does not function as warranted during its warranty period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, Licensee may return the Program and proof of entitlement to IBM or the IBM Business Partner for a refund of the amount Licensee paid and Licensee&apos;s license terminates.&#xA;&#xA;d. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of an IBM Program or that IBM will correct all defects or prevent third party disruptions. These warranties are the exclusive warranties from IBM and replace all other warranties, including the implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. IBM warranties will not apply if there has been misuse, modification, damage not caused by IBM, or failure to comply with written instructions provided by IBM. Non-IBM Programs are provided as-is, without warranties of any kind. Third parties may provide their own warranties to Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;e. Additional support available during or after the warranty period may be available under separate agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. Charges, Taxes, Payment, and Verification&#xA;&#xA;a. Licensee&apos;s right to use a Program is contingent on Licensee paying applicable charges as specified in the agreement under which Licensee acquired the license entitlements. Licensee is responsible to acquire additional license entitlements in advance of any increase of its use.&#xA;&#xA;b. Licensee agrees to pay all applicable charges for acquired entitlements and any charges for use in excess of authorizations. Charges are exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, and similar levies imposed by any authority resulting from Licensee&apos;s acquisition of entitlements and will be invoiced in addition to such charges. Amounts are due upon receipt of the invoice from IBM and payable within 30 days of the invoice date to an account specified by IBM and late payment fees may apply. Licensee is responsible to properly acquire additional license entitlements in advance to increase its use. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this IPLA, the applicable TD, or terms of the agreement under which Licensee acquired license entitlements.&#xA;&#xA;c. Based on acquired entitlements, Licensee agrees to: i) pay any withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to IBM; iii) pay IBM only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with IBM in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents.&#xA;&#xA;d. If Licensee imports, exports, transfers, accesses, or uses a Program across a border, Licensee agrees to be responsible for and pay authorities any custom, duty, tax, or similar levy assessed by the authorities. This excludes those taxes based on IBM&apos;s net income.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Licensing Verification&#xA;&#xA;a. Licensee will, for all Programs at all sites and for all environments, create, retain, and each year provide to IBM upon request with 30 days&apos; advance notice: i) a report, in a format requested by IBM using records, system tools output, and other system information; and ii) supporting documentation (collectively, &quot;Deployment Data&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;b. Upon reasonable notice, IBM and its independent auditors may verify Licensee&apos;s compliance with this Agreement, at all sites and for all environments, in which Licensee uses (for any purposes) Programs. Verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee&apos;s business and may be conducted on Licensee&apos;s premises, during normal business hours. IBM will have a written confidentiality agreement with the independent auditor. In addition to providing Deployment Data described above, Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors additional accurate information and Deployment Data upon request.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee will promptly order and pay charges at IBM&apos;s then current rates associated with: i) any deployments in excess of authorizations indicated on or by any annual report or verification; ii) applicable subscription &amp; support services (S&amp;S) for such excess deployments for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years; and iii) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification, including but not limited to taxes, duties, and regulatory fees.&#xA;&#xA;4. Liability and Intellectual Property Protection&#xA;&#xA;a. IBM&apos;s entire liability for all claims related to this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages incurred by Licensee up to the amounts paid (if recurring charges, up to 12 months&apos; charges apply) for the entitlements to the Program that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis of the claim. IBM will not be liable for special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or for lost profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. These limitations apply collectively to IBM, its affiliates, contractors, and suppliers.&#xA;&#xA;b. The following amounts are not subject to the above cap: i) third party payments related to infringement claims described in clause 4 c below; and ii) damages that cannot be limited under applicable law.&#xA;&#xA;c. If a third party asserts a claim against Licensee that an IBM Program infringes a patent or copyright, IBM will defend Licensee against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded by a court against Licensee or included in a settlement approved by IBM. To obtain IBM&apos;s defense against and payment of infringement claims, Licensee must promptly: i) notify IBM in writing of the claim; ii) supply information requested by IBM; and iii) allow IBM to control, and reasonably cooperate in, the defense and settlement, including mitigation efforts. IBM&apos;s defense and payment obligations for infringement claims extend to claims of infringement based on open source code that IBM selects and embeds in an IBM Program.&#xA;&#xA;d. IBM has no responsibility for claims based on non-IBM products, items not provided by IBM, or any violation of law or third party rights caused by Content, or any Licensee materials, designs, specifications, or use of a non-current version or release of an IBM Program when an infringement claim could have been avoided by using a current version or release. Content consists of all data, software, and information that Licensee or its authorized users provide, authorize access to, or inputs to a Program.&#xA;&#xA;5. Termination&#xA;&#xA;a. IBM may terminate Licensee&apos;s license to use a Program if Licensee fails to comply with the IPLA, TDs or acquisition agreements, such as the International Passport Advantage Agreement (IPAA). Licensee will promptly destroy all copies of the Program after license termination. Any terms that by their nature extend beyond the termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to successors and assignees.&#xA;&#xA;6. Governing Laws and Geographic Scope&#xA;&#xA;a. Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country where the transaction for license entitlements is performed, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Licensee is responsible for its use of IBM Programs and Non-IBM Programs. IBM is acting as an information technology provider only. IBM&apos;s direction, suggested usage, or guidance or use of a Program does not constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed professional advice.

If entitlements are acquired from an IBM Business Partner, the IBM company for the country of acquisition is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. No right or cause of action is created in favor of Licensee against IBM Corporation. Licensee waives all claims and causes of action against IBM Corporation and agrees to look solely to IBM for any rights and remedies in connection with Programs.&#xA;&#xA;h. Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the license for any Program (except to the extent assignment or transfer may not be legally restricted or as is expressly permitted in a TD or as otherwise agreed by IBM).

Neither party will bring a legal action arising out of or related to the Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose. Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its non-monetary obligations due to causes beyond its control. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not met its obligations.&#xA;&#xA;k. IBM may use personnel and resources in locations worldwide, including third party contractors to support the delivery of Programs and Program support.

        <property name='df_LT.license' value='LICENSE INFORMATION&#xA;&#xA;The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International Program License Agreement (i125-3301-15) applies.&#xA;&#xA;Program Name (Program Number):&#xA;IBM WebSphere Application Server Developer Tools for Eclipse 24.1 (Tool)&#xA;&#xA;The following standard terms apply to Licensee&apos;s use of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Modifiable Third Party Code&#xA;&#xA;To the extent, if any, in the NOTICES file IBM identifies third party code as &quot;Modifiable Third Party Code,&quot; IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee&apos;s modifications to such third party code. IBM&apos;s service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.&#xA;&#xA;The following units of measure may apply to Licensee&apos;s use of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Authorized User&#xA;&#xA;Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;L/N: L-LAAY-6AA88B&#xA;D/N: L-LAAY-6AA88B&#xA;P/N: L-LAAY-6AA88B&#xA;&#xA;International Program License Agreement&#xA;&#xA;Part 1 - General Terms&#xA;&#xA;BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY: i) DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND ii) PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA, DOCUMENTATION, AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.&#xA;&#xA;This International Program License Agreement (IPLA) and applicable Transaction Documents (together the &quot;Agreement&quot;) are the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of a Program. The country required terms included in Part 2 of this IPLA replace or modify the terms of Part 1.&#xA;&#xA;Transaction Documents (TDs) provide a description, information, and terms regarding the Program and its authorized use. Examples of TDs for Programs include license information (LI), licensed program specifications (LPS), quote, proof of entitlement (PoE), or invoice. To the extent of any conflict a TD will prevail over the IPLA.&#xA;&#xA;1. Program License&#xA;&#xA;a. A Program is an executable IBM-branded computer program and its related material and includes whole and partial copies. Program details are described in a TD available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla (for Passport Advantage Programs) or http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter (for other IBM Programs), in the Program&apos;s system command directory, or as otherwise specified by IBM. IBM software policies (such as backup, temporary use and IBM approved cloud environment) available at http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies apply to Licensee&apos;s use of Programs.&#xA;&#xA;b. Copies of Programs are copyrighted and licensed.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee is granted a nonexclusive license to:&#xA;&#xA;(1) use each copy of a Program, subject to the terms of the Agreement and up to the number of license entitlements Licensee acquires (&quot;Authorized Use&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;(2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use; and&#xA;&#xA;(3) make a backup copy.&#xA;&#xA;d. Programs may be used by Licensee, its employees and contractors. Licensee may not rent or lease a Program or provide commercial IT, hosting or timesharing services to any third party. Additional rights may be available for additional fees or under different terms.&#xA;&#xA;e. The license granted for a Program is subject to Licensee:&#xA;&#xA;(1) reproducing copyright notices and other markings on any copy;&#xA;&#xA;(2) ensuring anyone who uses the Program: i) does so only on Licensee&apos;s behalf within Licensee&apos;s Authorized Use; and ii) complies with this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;(3) not reverse assembling, reverse compiling, translating, or reverse engineering the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; and&#xA;&#xA;(4) not using any of the elements of the Program or related licensed materials separately from the Program.&#xA;&#xA;f. If the TD for a Program (&quot;Principal Program&quot;) states that a &quot;Supporting Program&quot; is included with the Principal Program, Licensee may use the Supporting Program subject to any license limitations of the Principal Program and only to support the Principal Program.&#xA;&#xA;g. This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.&#xA;&#xA;h. An update, fix, or patch to a Program is subject to the terms governing the Program unless new terms are provided in an updated TD. Licensee accepts such new terms upon installation of the update, fix, or patch. If a Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.&#xA;&#xA;i. If Licensee is dissatisfied with a Program for any reason, Licensee may terminate the license by returning the Program and proof of entitlement to IBM or the authorized IBM Business Partner within 30 days of the original acquisition date of such Program for a refund of the amount paid. For a downloaded Program, contact the party Licensee acquired the Program from for refund instructions.&#xA;&#xA;2. Warranties&#xA;&#xA;a. IBM warrants that a Program, when used in its specified operating environment conforms to its specifications. The warranty period for a Program is 12 months from acquisition, or the initial license term if less than 12 months, unless another warranty period is specified in the TD.&#xA;&#xA;b. During the warranty period Licensee will have access to IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses as described in the IBM Support Guide at http://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/733923.&#xA;&#xA;c. If the Program does not function as warranted during its warranty period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, Licensee may return the Program and proof of entitlement to IBM or the IBM Business Partner for a refund of the amount Licensee paid and Licensee&apos;s license terminates.&#xA;&#xA;d. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of an IBM Program or that IBM will correct all defects or prevent third party disruptions. These warranties are the exclusive warranties from IBM and replace all other warranties, including the implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. IBM warranties will not apply if there has been misuse, modification, damage not caused by IBM, or failure to comply with written instructions provided by IBM. Non-IBM Programs are provided as-is, without warranties of any kind. Third parties may provide their own warranties to Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;e. Additional support available during or after the warranty period may be available under separate agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. Charges, Taxes, Payment, and Verification&#xA;&#xA;a. Licensee&apos;s right to use a Program is contingent on Licensee paying applicable charges as specified in the agreement under which Licensee acquired the license entitlements. Licensee is responsible to acquire additional license entitlements in advance of any increase of its use.&#xA;&#xA;b. Licensee agrees to pay all applicable charges for acquired entitlements and any charges for use in excess of authorizations. Charges are exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, and similar levies imposed by any authority resulting from Licensee&apos;s acquisition of entitlements and will be invoiced in addition to such charges. Amounts are due upon receipt of the invoice from IBM and payable within 30 days of the invoice date to an account specified by IBM and late payment fees may apply. Licensee is responsible to properly acquire additional license entitlements in advance to increase its use. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this IPLA, the applicable TD, or terms of the agreement under which Licensee acquired license entitlements.&#xA;&#xA;c. Based on acquired entitlements, Licensee agrees to: i) pay any withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to IBM; iii) pay IBM only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with IBM in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents.&#xA;&#xA;d. If Licensee imports, exports, transfers, accesses, or uses a Program across a border, Licensee agrees to be responsible for and pay authorities any custom, duty, tax, or similar levy assessed by the authorities. This excludes those taxes based on IBM&apos;s net income.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Licensing Verification&#xA;&#xA;a. Licensee will, for all Programs at all sites and for all environments, create, retain, and each year provide to IBM upon request with 30 days&apos; advance notice: i) a report, in a format requested by IBM using records, system tools output, and other system information; and ii) supporting documentation (collectively, &quot;Deployment Data&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;b. Upon reasonable notice, IBM and its independent auditors may verify Licensee&apos;s compliance with this Agreement, at all sites and for all environments, in which Licensee uses (for any purposes) Programs. Verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee&apos;s business and may be conducted on Licensee&apos;s premises, during normal business hours. IBM will have a written confidentiality agreement with the independent auditor. In addition to providing Deployment Data described above, Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors additional accurate information and Deployment Data upon request.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee will promptly order and pay charges at IBM&apos;s then current rates associated with: i) any deployments in excess of authorizations indicated on or by any annual report or verification; ii) applicable subscription &amp; support services (S&amp;S) for such excess deployments for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years; and iii) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification, including but not limited to taxes, duties, and regulatory fees.&#xA;&#xA;4. Liability and Intellectual Property Protection&#xA;&#xA;a. IBM&apos;s entire liability for all claims related to this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages incurred by Licensee up to the amounts paid (if recurring charges, up to 12 months&apos; charges apply) for the entitlements to the Program that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis of the claim. IBM will not be liable for special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or for lost profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. These limitations apply collectively to IBM, its affiliates, contractors, and suppliers.&#xA;&#xA;b. The following amounts are not subject to the above cap: i) third party payments related to infringement claims described in clause 4 c below; and ii) damages that cannot be limited under applicable law.&#xA;&#xA;c. If a third party asserts a claim against Licensee that an IBM Program infringes a patent or copyright, IBM will defend Licensee against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded by a court against Licensee or included in a settlement approved by IBM. To obtain IBM&apos;s defense against and payment of infringement claims, Licensee must promptly: i) notify IBM in writing of the claim; ii) supply information requested by IBM; and iii) allow IBM to control, and reasonably cooperate in, the defense and settlement, including mitigation efforts. IBM&apos;s defense and payment obligations for infringement claims extend to claims of infringement based on open source code that IBM selects and embeds in an IBM Program.&#xA;&#xA;d. IBM has no responsibility for claims based on non-IBM products, items not provided by IBM, or any violation of law or third party rights caused by Content, or any Licensee materials, designs, specifications, or use of a non-current version or release of an IBM Program when an infringement claim could have been avoided by using a current version or release. Content consists of all data, software, and information that Licensee or its authorized users provide, authorize access to, or inputs to a Program.&#xA;&#xA;5. Termination&#xA;&#xA;a. IBM may terminate Licensee&apos;s license to use a Program if Licensee fails to comply with the IPLA, TDs or acquisition agreements, such as the International Passport Advantage Agreement (IPAA). Licensee will promptly destroy all copies of the Program after license termination. Any terms that by their nature extend beyond the termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to successors and assignees.&#xA;&#xA;6. Governing Laws and Geographic Scope&#xA;&#xA;a. Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country where the transaction for license entitlements is performed, without regard to conflict of law principles. The rights and obligations of each party are valid only in the country where the transaction to acquire license entitlements is performed or, if IBM agrees, the country where the Program is placed in productive use, except all licenses are valid as specifically granted.&#xA;&#xA;b. Each party is also responsible for complying with: i) laws and regulations applicable to its business and Content; and ii) import, export and economic sanction laws and regulations, including the defense trade control regime of the United States of America and any applicable jurisdictions, that prohibit or restrict the import, export, re-export, or transfer of products, technology, services or data, directly or indirectly, to or for certain countries, end uses or end users.&#xA;&#xA;c. If any provision of this Agreement for a Program, is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Nothing in this Agreement affects statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;7. General&#xA;&#xA;a. IBM is an independent contractor, not Licensee&apos;s agent, joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to perform any of Licensee&apos;s regulatory obligations, or assume any responsibility for Licensee&apos;s business or operations. Licensee is responsible for its use of IBM Programs and Non-IBM Programs. IBM is acting as an information technology provider only. IBM&apos;s direction, suggested usage, or guidance or use of a Program does not constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed professional advice. Licensee should obtain its own expert advice.&#xA;&#xA;b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee may not use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, serious bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.&#xA;&#xA;d. IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either require use of business contact information and certain account usage information. This information is not Content. Business contact information is used to communicate and manage business dealings with the Licensee. Examples of business contact information include name, business telephone, address, email, user ID, and tax registration information. Account usage information is required to enable, provide, manage, support, administer, and improve Programs. Examples of account usage information include reported errors and digital information gathered using tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, during use of the Programs. The IBM Privacy Statement at http://www.ibm.com/privacy provides additional details with respect to IBM&apos;s collection, use, and handling of business contact and account usage information. When Licensee provides information to IBM and notice to, or consent by, the individuals is required for such processing, Licensee will notify individuals and obtain consent.&#xA;&#xA;e. IBM Business Partners who use or make available Programs are independent from IBM and unilaterally determine their prices and terms. IBM is not responsible for their actions, omissions, statements, or offerings.&#xA;&#xA;f. IBM may offer Non-IBM Programs, or an IBM Program may enable access to Non-IBM Programs, that may require acceptance of third party terms identified in a TD or presented to the Licensee. Linking to or use of Non-IBM Programs constitutes Licensee&apos;s agreement with such terms. IBM is not a party to any third party agreement and is not responsible for such Non-IBM Programs.&#xA;&#xA;g. License grants to Programs are provided by International Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation (&quot;IBM Corporation&quot;). The IBM company from which the Licensee acquires entitlements (&quot;IBM&quot;) is acting as a distributor and delivering Programs and is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. If entitlements are acquired from an IBM Business Partner, the IBM company for the country of acquisition is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. No right or cause of action is created in favor of Licensee against IBM Corporation. Licensee waives all claims and causes of action against IBM Corporation and agrees to look solely to IBM for any rights and remedies in connection with Programs.&#xA;&#xA;h. Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the license for any Program (except to the extent assignment or transfer may not be legally restricted or as is expressly permitted in a TD or as otherwise agreed by IBM). IBM may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in conjunction with the sale of the portion of IBM&apos;s business that includes a Program. IBM may share this Agreement and related documents in conjunction with any assignment.&#xA;&#xA;i. All notices under the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the business address specified in the agreement Licensee acquired the license entitlements unless a party designates in writing a different address. The parties consent to the use of electronic means and facsimile transmissions for communications as a signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable means is considered an original. Agreement supersedes any course of dealing, discussions or representations, between the parties.&#xA;&#xA;j. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by the Agreement. Neither party will bring a legal action arising out of or related to the Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose. Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its non-monetary obligations due to causes beyond its control. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not met its obligations.&#xA;&#xA;k. IBM may use personnel and resources in locations worldwide, including third party contractors to support the delivery of Programs and Program support. Licensee&apos;s use of Programs may result in the transfer of Content, including personally identifiable information, across country borders to provide Program support as described in the IBM Software Support Guide.&#xA;&#xA;Part 2 - Country Required Terms&#xA;&#xA;For licenses acquired in the countries specified below, the following terms replace or modify the referenced terms of this IPLA.
